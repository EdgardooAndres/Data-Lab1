# Data-Lab1
In this programming project, you will implement three approaches to solve a simple problem: given a list of  objects, count how many occurrences of each different object exist in that list; which is the same as determining the frequency distribution of different objects in the list. In addition to that, you will also implement a component whose goal is to experiment with those three alternatives to measure the efficiency of each strategy in terms of execution time.
